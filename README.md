For educational purposes only....

This application was written in order to demonstrate how easy it is to scrape facebook profiles with a UI testing framework. With only a few lines of code we're able to scrape pages and pages worth of profiles by any search query we choose.

Simply change target to:
- Name
- Name and Location
- Company
- Location

Then run the application. This could easily be expanded on to scrape friends of targets, interests, photos and more. I plan on continuing to build this out in the coming weeks.
